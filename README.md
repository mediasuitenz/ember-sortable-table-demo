# Ember-Sortable-Table demo

I created a separate repo for this, because I couldn't get the config on the dummy app within ember-sortable-table to work properly.

Clone this repo, install with npm and bower, then `ember serve` and you should be golden.

Note: package.json currently pins the ember-sortable-table version to the "spike" branch, so we have a working demo for the pull request.
